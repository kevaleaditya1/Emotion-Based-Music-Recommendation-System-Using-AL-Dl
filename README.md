Mood detection based on emotion is the one of the current topic in the various fields which provides solution to various
challenges. Beside traditional challenges in captured facial images under uncontrolled settings such as varying poses,
different lighting and expressions for face recognition and different sound frequencies for emotion recognition. For the
any face and mood detection system database is the most important part for the comparison of the face features and
sound Mel frequency components. For database creation features of the face are calculated and these features are store
in the database. This database is then use for the evaluation of the face and emotion by using different algorithms.
 Emotional aspects have more impact on social intelligence like communication understanding, decision
making and also helps in understanding behavioral attitude of human. Emotion play important role during
communication. Emotion recognition is implemented out in diverse way; it may be verbal or non-verbal. Voice
(Audible) is verbal way of communication & Facial expression, action, body postures and gesture is non-verbal form of
communication. Human can recognize emotions without any meaningful delay and effort but recognition of facial
expression by machine is a big challenge.

 One of the most interesting areas of human computer interaction is face detection and identification.
Distinguishing facial features are comparatively low and it is most interesting task to observe these. Detection and
identification face objects from face is a challenging task.
Finding a human emotion using human’s face which can be one of the most challenging assignments you will handle
in your career. A face is the best way to detect and recognize a human. No recognition algorithms will work without
face detection step. Rate of detection affects the recognition stage. With all these noise is a very intriguing task to
detect and localize an unknown non-face from still image. Face emotion detection applications is still a challenging
task since face images may be affected by changes in the scene, such as pose variation, face expression, or illumination.
The main goal to propose this system is to find the human mood with the help face image as input and after that usingthese
emotion results to play the audio file. A face recognition technique which is used here to matches the train face
image to the original input face image.
 The proposed approach is simple, efficient, and accurate. This system gives accurate result as compare to
existing approach. System play’s very important role in recognition and detection related field. That is this gives
important result very quickly as compare to traditional methods. 

ADVANTAGES PROPOSED SYSTEM:
1. Face detection and cropping
2. Detection the mood of human using human face image features.
3. Play audio file using ML based on human mood.
